# pythonGaeAES
Pass encrypted data between a Python-GAE server and a client
The following files are included in the set:

Client.png:
  a screen capture image of what the client web page looks like
Key.txt:
  a text file containing the key. Using a constant key to facilitate testing
main.html:
  html file
main.py
  the python file
server after submit.png
  a screen page of the server output after the post.
  
  
All seems to work ok, EXCEPT THAT the string encrypted at the client and decrypted
by the server has a number of non-printable leading characters I do not understand.
